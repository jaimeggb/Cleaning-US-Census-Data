# Cleaning-US-Census-Data

## Description: 
In this repo I agregate data from multiple files from the US census and I create histograms and scatterplots of the data to obtain insights from it. It is all based on the following prompt:

"You just got hired as a Data Analyst at the Census Bureau, which collects census data and creates interesting visualizations and insights from it.

The person who had your job before you left you all the data they had for the most recent census. It is in multiple `csv` files. They didn't use pandas, they would just look through these `csv` files manually whenever they wanted to find something. Sometimes they would copy and paste certain numbers into Excel to make charts.

The thought of it makes you shiver. This is not scalable or repeatable.

Your boss wants you to make some scatterplots and histograms by the end of the day. Can you get this data into `pandas` and into reasonable shape so that you can make these histograms?"
